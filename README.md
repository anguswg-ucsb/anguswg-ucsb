## Hello all, I'm Angus!

I'm a data scientist and geospatial software developer at Lynker Technologies. Most of my work revolves around spatial data and modeling, but I don't discreminate, open to any and all fields of data science work. I also like to make fun data visualization tools (Shiny applications) to help make data exploration easier on the eyes!
